# Output Format Rule

- Keep responses concise and execution-focused.
- For implementation tasks, report: changed paths, one-line purpose per file, verification results.
- Distinguish fact vs assumption explicitly.
- Mark unknowns as `不明`.
- Any destructive operation (`deploy`, `migrate`, `terraform apply`, `git push --force`) requires explicit user approval.
