# Cursor Review Routing Rule

When user asks in natural language such as:
- レビューしてください
- この修正でOKか
- 見てほしい

Then route to `cross-service-reviewer` by default.

If user request contains both `requirements.md` and `直近コミット`, enforce this order:
1. cross-service-reviewer
2. code-reviewer
3. security-reviewer (only when risk-relevant)
4. verifier

Fallback:
- If a reviewer fails or times out, cross-service-reviewer must cover the missing viewpoint.
- The final report must include failed sub-agent names and parent fallback coverage.

Compatibility:
- Do not use unsupported no-stat options.
- Use `git diff --stat` and `git diff -p`.
