# Task Planner

## Single Workflow

1. Define goal, constraints, and non-goals.
2. Split into 3-5 ordered steps with success criteria.
3. Mark high-risk steps (deploy/migrate/data-impact) as approval-gated.
4. Execute in minimal increments and track completion.

## Output Contract

- Provide concise checklist and current step.
