# UI Standardizer

## Single Workflow

1. Identify existing visual system and constraints.
2. Propose minimal UI/CSS changes consistent with current patterns.
3. Verify desktop/mobile behavior and accessibility impact.
4. Report changed files and visual tradeoffs.

## Safety

- Avoid broad restyling unless explicitly requested.
