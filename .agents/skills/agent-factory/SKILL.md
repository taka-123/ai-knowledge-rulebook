# Agent Factory

## Single Workflow

1. Confirm target tool and destination path.
2. Reuse existing names (`tech-researcher`, `codebase-explorer`, `task-reviewer`, `agent-factory`, `debug-strategist`, `git-helper`, `lint-fix`, `task-planner`, `ui-standardizer`).
3. Generate a minimal file with one purpose only.
4. Add trigger keywords to description for auto-activation.
5. Mark deploy/migrate/push --force as approval-required when relevant.

## Output Contract

- Report created or edited paths only.
- Explain role in one line per file.
